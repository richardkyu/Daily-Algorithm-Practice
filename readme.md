Daily Algorithm Practice
===
My approach is to collect algorithms from various existing repositories and other online resources and come up with my own solutions.

#### Languages
- python, javascript, eventually golang

#### Target topics
- Basic Syntax 
- Binary Search
- Binary Search Tree
- Binary Tree
- Famous Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (Kadane's Algorithm)
- Tries (N-array trees)
- Graph(Dijkstra, Union Find, Kruskal, Prim's, Minimum Spanning Tree, Topological Ordering, etc.)
- Strings
- Stacks
- Queue
- Arrays
- Sorting
- Hash Table
- Heap
- Linked list
- Bit Operation
- Recursion
- Backtracking(Permutations & Combinations & Subsets...etc)
- Math

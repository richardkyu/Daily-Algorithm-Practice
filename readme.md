Daily Algorithm Practice
===
My approach is to collect algorithms from various existing repositories and other online resources and come up with my own solutions.

#### Languages
- python, javascript, eventually golang

#### Target topics
- Basic Syntax 
- Binary Search
- Binary Search Tree
- Binary Tree
- Famous Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (Kadane's Algorithm)
- Tries (N-array trees)
- Graph(Dijkstra, Union Find, Kruskal, Prim's, Minimum Spanning Tree, Topological Ordering, etc.)
- Strings
- Stacks
- Queue
- Arrays
- Sorting
- Hash Table
- Heap
- Linked list
- Bit Operation
- Recursion
- Backtracking(Permutations & Combinations & Subsets...etc)
- Math

| Day  | Task | Type | From | remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [binary search](/solutions/binarysearch.py) | binary search | [leetcode 704](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search) | [Bisection method](https://docs.python.org/2/library/bisect.html), O(log n) time complexity for binary search method |
| 2 | [sqrt(x)](/solutions/sqrt.py) | binary search | [leetcode 69](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/) | This was just making a square root|
| 3 | [search in rotated sorted array](/solutions/rotatedsortedarray.py) | binary search | [leetcode 33](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array) | Need to review how the logic works here |
| 4 | [two sum (python)](solutions/two-sum.py) </br> </br> [two sum (javascript)](solutions/two-sum.js)| find indices of two elements that make a sum | [leetcode 1](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | 1. the some() function works similarly to python's in, it checks a list for a target value and exits if true is returned. </br> 2. I learned that when making an arrow function, the parameters specified (a,b,c) correspond to (current element, index of element, and current containing array). </br> 3. I learned about the javascript Map object, which uses the has(), get(), and set() methods. |
| 5 | [add two numbers (javascript)](/solutions/addtwonumbers.js) | You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list. | [leetcode 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers) | Added a na√Øve solution, will update after researching a more efficient solution. |
